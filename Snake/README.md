# Snake
A simple p5.js snake game with global highscore leaderboard.

## TODO
 - [ ] Upgrade server from json to PostgreSQL to that it doesn't reset scores every server reboot.
 - [ ] Add powerups to snake.
 - [ ] Increase security of score submitions so that users can't fake them.

## Client

## Server
Nodejs backend hosted on heroku with json used to store score list. An upgrade to PostgreSQL database would add improved functionality.
