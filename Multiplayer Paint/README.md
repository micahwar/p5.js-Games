# Multiplayer Paint

A p5.js multiplayer paint website using a nodejs backend. Slightly incomplete repository due to the size of node_modules folder.

Can be accessed at http://micahwar.herokuapp.com/

- [ ] Fix glitch where a circle is drawn every time user clicks the sliders.
- [ ] Fix slight graphical glitch in the top left where there's a permenant grey rectangle.
